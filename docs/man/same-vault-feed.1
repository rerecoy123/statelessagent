.SH NAME
same-vault-feed - Copy notes from one vault to another with PII guard


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsame vault feed [source] [target] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
One-way note propagation between vaults. Reads notes from the source
vault and copies them to the target vault. Each note is scanned by the PII
guard before copying — notes with detected PII violations are blocked.

.PP
Source and target must be registered vault aliases. Notes are copied into a
\&'fed//' subdirectory in the target vault to avoid collisions.

.PP
Private notes (_PRIVATE/), hidden files, and symlinks are never copied.

.PP
Example:
  same vault feed dev marketing
  same vault feed dev marketing --dry-run
