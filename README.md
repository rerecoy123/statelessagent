## 📋 What is statelessagent?

statelessagent is a simple desktop tool that helps you use AI without storing your past chats. This means your conversations stay private and don't carry over from one session to the next. It works locally on your computer, so you do not need any special accounts or API keys. The program comes as a single file you download and run.

statelessagent is useful when you want to test AI tools but do not want them to remember your earlier inputs. It supports different AI models and can handle information saved on your computer in a way that keeps your data safe and private.
